            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 07, 2020 by <a href="#">Tom</a></p>
            <p>If you’re the typical guy in the gym working with weights, not only do you want to lose some fat, but
                also gain some muscle.

                This article discusses the mechanisms of how muscles grow, plus why most women won’t gain large amounts
                of muscle when working with weights.</p>


            <h3>3 Mechanisms That Make Muscles Grow</h3>
            <p>
                Underlying all progression of natural muscle growth is the ability to continually put more stress on the
                muscles. This stress is a major component involved in the growth of a muscle and disrupts homeostasis
                within your body. The stress and subsequent disruption in homeostasis causes three main mechanisms that
                spur on muscle growth.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Muscle Tension</h3>
                </li>
                <p>In order to produce muscle growth, you have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body
                    or muscles had previously adapted too. How do you do this? The main way is to lift progressively
                    heavier weights. This additional tension on the muscle helps to cause changes in the chemistry
                    of the muscle, allowing for growth factors that include mTOR activation and satellite cell
                    activation.

                    Muscular tension also most dramatically effects the connection of the motor units with the
                    muscle cells. Two other factors help to explain why some people can be stronger, but not as big
                    as other people.</p>
                <li>
                    <h3>Muscle Damage</h3>
                </li>
                <p>If you’ve ever felt sore after a workout, you have experienced the localized muscle damage from
                    working out. This local muscle damage causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system
                    cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action. This doesn’t mean that you have to feel
                    sore in order for this to happen, but instead that the damage from the workout has to be present in
                    your muscle cells. Typically soreness is attenuated over time by other mechanisms.</p>
                <li>
                    <h3>Metabolic Stress</h3>
                </li>
                <p>If you’ve ever felt the burn of an exercise or had the “pump” in the gym, then you’ve felt the
                    effects of metabolic stress. Scientists used to question bodybuilders when they said the “pump”
                    caused their muscles to become larger. After more investigation, it seems as though they were onto
                    something.</p>
            </ul>
