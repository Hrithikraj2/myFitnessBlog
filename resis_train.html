            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 20, 2020 by <a href="#">Peter</a></p>

            <p>Resistance training is a form of exercise that improves muscular strength and endurance. This is also
                known as strength training or weight lifting. During a resistance training workout, you move your limbs
                against resistance provided by your body weight, gravity, bands, weighted bars, or dumbbells. Some
                exercise machines can also be used for resistance training.</p>

            <h3>Definition and Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Any exercise where you move your body against resistance can be considered resistance or strength
                training. The definition of resistance in this form of training is simple as well. Resistance is any
                force that makes the movement harder to perform.


            </p>
            <p>
                Resistance can be provided simply by moving your body against gravity or by adding weighted dumbbells.
                You can also add resistance by using machines at the gym or by using equipment such as weighted bars,
                bands, or kettlebells. This form of training can also be called weight lifting or weight training.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits of resistance training are significant. If you start a weight training program, you can
                expect your body to get stronger, tighter, and leaner.
            </p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>There are some myths about resistance training and resistance training exercises that may keep you from
                starting a program. These are common questions that new exercisers ask about strength training.</p>

            <h3>Will weight lifting make you bulk up?</h3>
            <p>Most women will not bulk up if they start doing resistance training exercises. But both men and women may
                notice more muscle definition when they start lifting weights. But this form of exercise helps the
                muscles to look tighter and more sculpted, not fat. The amount of muscle definition that you see will
                depend on the amount of fat that is covering the muscle.</p>

            <h3>How does resistance training affect your weight?</h3>
            <p>Weight training may increase your weight slightly. But muscle mass is more dense than fat mass and takes
                up less space. So even though your body weight may increase, your body size may shrink. In addition,
                muscle helps you to maintain a healthy metabolism. Muscle burns more calories than fat, so if you build
                muscle and reduce fat, you'll burn more calories all day long.</p>

            <h3>Can you do resistance training exercises every day?
            </h3>
            <p>You can lift weights every day, but you shouldn't train the same muscles every day. Muscles need time to
                repair and rebuild. Many exercisers do some strength training every day, but alternate body parts. For
                example, they might do upper body exercises one day, and lower body exercises the next.</p>

            <h3>Do You Need Protein Supplements?</h3>
            <p>Most exercisers don't need protein powders or supplements to make the most of their resistance training
                program. In fact, some supplements can do more harm than good. You can get the protein and nutrients you
                need from eating a healthy, nutritious diet..</p>
