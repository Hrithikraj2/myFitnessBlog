            <h2> First Things First</h2>
            Whenever you come up with any workout plan keep in mind that muscle building and fat reducing takes time.
            For some it may take weeks, for some months and others years. So the main key here is to be patient all
            through the process.
            As things won't change overnight, they change overtime. Same applies to your physique.
            <h2>Calorie Needs and Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>The primary goal is to increase muscle mass in the bulking phase and reduce body fat
                in the cutting phase. One could also prefer Body Recomposition where he may gain muscle mass
                and loose fat at the same time. For bulking, you need to be in calorie surplus and proportionally
                for cutting (dropping body fat percentage) you need to be in calorie deficit.
            </p>

            <h3>Lets dig deeper into diet</h3>
            <p>You should be well aware of the intake of your food. You must ensure that you have a balanced diet.
                You should fill in your diet with 40 % protein, 20 % fat and rest with carbohydrates and micro
                nutrients.
                One shouldn't neglect micronutrients as they play a major role in synthesizing your macro diet.
            <p> About 70% of your muscle contains water so make sure that you drink a minimum 3 - 4 litres of water
                everday. While aiming
                for body recomposition you should cut down your intake of salt and sugar.</p>
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid " src="micro.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>What should your pre-workout and post-workout meals be?</h3>
            <p>There are many options availabe as to what to consume before and after workout. Well, ideally bananas
                should be your
                first preference as a pre-workout meal as the results show that 2 bananas provide enough energy for a 90
                min intense workout.
            <p> It is important to
                have a post-workout meal as this is found to be effective with better results. Protein shakes should be
                preferred right
                after workout.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>How Many Calories Do You Need?</h3>
            <p>The efficient way to estimate how many calories you need to maintain your weight is use the maintenance
                calorie
                caluculator or weigh yourself on regular basis by tracking your diet if you do not loose or gain weight
                with that
                diet, that's your maintenance calories.</p>
            <p>When you plan for bulking, make sure that you prefer clean bulk. Clean Bulk is that the proportion of fat
                that you consume
                while bulking should be low. Keep your carbs and proteins as high as possible. Make sure that you
                maintain less than
                or 15 % of caloric surplus during your bulk phase.
            </p>
            <p>Similarily when to plan to cut make sure that you are high on proteins. Here, the important part is that
                while
                cutting you may loose muscle mass. So make sure that you don't fall below 15% of calorie deficit than
                your maintenance
                calories in order to preserve your muscle mass while loosing fat.
            </p>
            <p>Gradually as you progress make sure that you make minor changes in your calorie surplus and calorie
                deficit in your bulking and cutting phase respectively to get better results. It's advised not to loose/gain more 
		than 0.5 kg of your body weight per week. Slower the process, better are the results.
            </p>
            <p>During either phase, it’s recommended not to lose or gain more than 0.5–1% of your body weight per week.
                This ensures that you don’t lose too much muscle during the cutting phase or gain too much body fat
                during the bulking phase</p>

            <h3>Macronutrient Ratio</h3>
            <p>Once you calculate the number of calories you need, you can determine your macronutrient ratio, which is
                the ratio between your protein, carbohydrate and fat intake.

                Unlike the difference in your calorie needs between the bulking and cutting phase, your macronutrient
                ratio doesn't change.</p>
            <h3>Micronutrient Ratio</h3>
            <p>Whatever your plan is make sure than you consume micronutrients on regular basis. As these help in
                synthesizing and act
                as a background in your whole diet plan.
            </p>
            <h3>Protein Sources</h3>
            <p>As we have already discussed that protein is the most important macronutrient one should consume inorder
                to see a change
                in their physique. Below are some protein sources that you may find available anywhere in the market.
            </p>
            <h5>Non-Vegetarian Protein Sources</h5>
            <p>If you are a non-vegetarian then chicken and eggs should be your all time favourite. These are best for
                your workout plan.
                Other sources include mutton, fish, shrimp etc.
            </p>
            <h5>Vegetarian Protein Sources</h5>
            <p>If you are a vegetarian then tofu and soya beans should be your first preference. These are best for
                your workout plan.
                Other sources include nuts, dry fruits, milk products, leafy vegetables etc.
            </p>
