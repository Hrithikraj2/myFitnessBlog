            <p>"Supplements are never a substitute for a balanced, healthful diet," says Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor
                of medicine at Harvard Medical School and professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of
                Public Health. "And they can be a distraction from healthy lifestyle practices that confer much greater
                benefits."</p>


            <p>
                Dietary supplement is an umbrella term that includes everything from vitamins and minerals to botanicals
                and biosimilar products (such as so-called "natural male hormone"). For the most part, though, people
                use "supplement" to mean an individual vitamin or mineral preparation or a multivitamin (that is, a
                product that contains 10 or more vitamins, minerals, or both).

                Even though supplements are popular, there is limited evidence that they offer any significant health
                benefits. In fact, a study published online May 28, 2018, by the Journal of the American College of
                Cardiology, found that the four most commonly used supplements — multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and
                vitamin C — did not protect against cardiovascular disease.
            </p>

            <p>
                So why do so many people take supplements if the health benefits are negligible or nonexistent for the
                average, healthy person? "People often think of them as something extra they can do to be sure their
                basic nutritional needs are covered," says Dr. Manson. There's also a possible placebo effect to taking
                supplements, she adds. "People feel healthier if they do something they believe makes them healthy."

                The greatest issue with supplements is that they are not regulated by the FDA. "Supplements can appear
                on the shelf without having to prove they offer any benefits," says Dr. Manson. "With limited regulation
                and oversight, it's also difficult to know for certain that the supplement contains the ingredients on
                the label and is free of contaminants."

                <p>Most supplements are safe to take, but there are exceptions. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High doses of beta carotene have been linked to a greater risk of lung cancer in smokers.</li>
                    <li>Extra calcium and vitamin D may increase the risk of kidney stones.</li>
                    <li>High doses of vitamin E may lead to stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin K can interfere with the anti-clotting effects of blood thinners.</li>
                    <li>Taking high amounts of vitamin B6 for a year or longer has been associated with nerve damage
                        that can impair body movements (the symptoms often go away after the supplements are stopped).
                    </li>
                </ul>
