        <p>Have you ever seen someone at the gym doing the exact opposite of what you were taught? Chances are, one of
            you is doing things wrong.

            But how do you know who's right? And who can you trust when it comes to fitness myths and facts?</p>


        <ol>
            <h4>
                <li>Spot Reduction Works</li>
            </h4>
            <p>False</p>
            <p>Trying to lose your gut by just doing sit-ups is futile. One million ab exercises a day won't flatten a
                stomach that is covered in layers of fat.

                Burning calories through frequent, consistent cardiovascular exercise helps shed belly fat. Combine this
                with an improved diet, and you'll create a calorie deficit, which trims the belly and other areas of
                your body.

                Eventually, certain exercises will help tone the muscles, which will become visible when the excess fat
                is gone</p>

            <h4>
                <li>You Have Lower, Middle and Upper Abs</li>
            </h4>
            <p>It's all one muscle.</p>
            <p>To effectively target regions of your erectus abdominus, you need to pre-fatigue certain parts of it.
                With a crunch series, for instance, you'll need to fatigue the top of your abs, then the middle in order
                to get to the bottom.</p>


            <h4>
                <li>Deep Squats Are Bad For Your Knees</li>
            </h4>
            <p>There's not a lot of evidence that links squats and knee pain.</p>
            <p>When squatting, you should keep the weight light enough so you can work through a full range of motion.
                The best squat is one in which you can sit your butt to your heels without weight.

                Have you ever seen a baby bend down to pick something up? They go all the way down until their diaper
                touches their heels. We lose that ability as we age and stiffen up. Work towards getting back to that
                deep squat, then squat deeply with moderate weight. This won't hurt you so long as you maintain proper
                technique.</p>


            <h4>
                <li>Deadlifts Are Bad For Your Back</li>
            </h4>
            <p>People don't hurt their backs just because they're doing deadlifts. They hurt their backs while
                deadlifting when they sacrifice technique to move weight.

                There are ways to compromise your form to get the weight up, but they are not beneficial in the long
                run.</p>


            <h4>
                <li>You Need to Load up on Protein After Lifting</li>
            </h4>
            <p>Your body can only digest about 12 to 15 grams of protein in a meal.

                With a good diet, you shouldn't have to supplement protein unless you're a serious body builder. Any
                extra protein will either be excreted or just hang around your waist line as extra calories.</p>


            <h4>
                <li>Lifting Weights Makes Women Bulky</li>
            </h4>
            <p>Your body can only digest about 12 to 15 grams of protein in a meal.</p>
            <p>With a good diet, you shouldn't have to supplement protein unless you're a serious body builder. Any
                extra protein will either be excreted or just hang around your waist line as extra calories.</p>
