            <p>Regular exercise and the consumption of a healthy diet together with having enough rest are the main
                three components of health which can lead you to a host of benefits, including increased energy,
                happiness, and even a long life. The three components of health are pivotal to determining a person’s
                overall health, and making them part of your lifestyle can make a dramatic difference in how you look
                and feel.</p>


            <p>
                To be healthy, all those three components must be relatively balanced and covering each other. This
                means that your nutrition plan and the amount of rest must be sufficient according to the amount of
                physical activities you will have on a particular day. Also, nutrition, rest and the type of physical
                activities, or exercises, must be aligned with what you plan to achieve in terms of fitness goals.
            </p>

            <p>If you’re overweight, eating healthfully and exercising regularly can help you lose weight safely and
                keep it off. This is what we call “Losing Weight in a Healthy Way” at the YWCA Fitness on 25th! If you
                don’t have a weight problem, physical activity and a healthy diet can help you maintain your current
                weight and reduce your risk of gaining weight as you age. Healthy foods are generally lower in calories
                and higher in nutrients than other foods, and regular physical activity burns off extra calories to keep
                a healthy physique.</p>

            <p>Exercise and healthy eating can help make your life more diverse and interesting. Seek creative ways to
                be physically active in your daily life and do not stick with the same exercise routine all the time.
                Exercise with co-workers, go dancing with friends, play on a sports team and spend active time with your
                kids and family members. Following a healthy diet can also bring up opportunities for home cooking,
                culinary classes, farmers’ market visits and more fun activities.
            </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What you need to always remember is that you could have the
                        healthiest nutrition plan, the best exercise program and superb dedication to put in hard work
                        at the gym. But if you do not have enough rest, you won’t be able to accomplish your fitness
                        goals and optimum health.</strong></p>
